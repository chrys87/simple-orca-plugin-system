1. How to write a plugin:

1.1 File name:
structure:
description-<command>+control+alt+<key char>.sh
The description is optional, its used for key assign announcement.
It don't have to be a shell script. python, Perl and anything that produce an STD out also works here.

1.2 Modifiers / Keys /Commands
1.2.1 Modifiers
you always have to press the orca key.
control= CTRL key
shift = shift key
alt = Alt key
the order of those three modifier keys doesn't matter and they are optional
but if they are exist only a few combinations (predefined by orca) is valid:
Valid modifier combinations:
alt (description-alt+w.sh)
control (description-control+w.sh)
shift (description-shift+w.sh)
control + alt (description-control+alt+w.sh)

1.2.2 Key
<Key char> is a single character. It is not optional.
d.sh uses orca + d as shortcut. The <char> has to be always the last character in 
The file name before the extension starts.

1.2.3 Commands and Plugin settings
with <command> you could control the behavior of the plugins. you could add more than one command. the order is optional. 
startnotify = announce "start <description>" before the plugin is executed. this useful as feedback for 
commands with longer progress times.
stopnotify = announce "finish <description>". This is useful as feedback for plugins with no output.
blockcall = don't start plugin in a thread, be careful, this locks orca until the plugin is finish
showstderr = not only show stdout but also stderr

1.3 File content:
Just normal shell, Perl, python  scripts. orca will read the STD out (examples included)

2 Administration
2.1 Folders
plugins-available:
contains all existing plugin and the administration scripts. Its the plugin repository.
plugins-enabled:
contains the enabled (active) plugin. this folder will be read by orca.

2.2 Administration tools
The tools are located in the plugins-available folder 
./ensop <pluginname> #enables an plugin so its active
./dissop <pluginname> #disable the plugin, its not loaded anymore.
They just create links in plugins-enabled and make the plugins executable.
To reload the plugins in orca, you have to restart orca
